# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/perspective-dev/perspective/security/advisories/new)
tab.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the
[npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a
security vulnerability".

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days,
or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may
escalate to the OpenJS Foundation CNA at `security@lists.openjsf.org`.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further
response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.
